# Qualitative Coding Tool — Backend (Flask + SQLite)

This is the backend API for a qualitative coding platform designed for tagging and annotating TikTok videos. It supports project setup, coder progress tracking, autosaving of responses, and final submission of coded entries.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Create and manage coding projects
- Upload CSV datasets for each project
- Track coder progress through videos
- Autosave tag and note drafts per video
- Submit finalized coding responses
- Resume incomplete work (draft recovery)
- Navigate to next/previous/specific videos
- **NEW:** Export coded data to CSV format
- **NEW:** Comprehensive project management
- **NEW:** Support for excluded videos and status tracking

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python 3.9+
- Flask
- Flask-SQLAlchemy
- Flask-CORS
- SQLite (file-based database)

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone and navigate into the project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
cd your-repo/qual-coding-backend
```

### 2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate         # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Create database and tables

```bash
mkdir -p data
export FLASK_APP=app.py          # Windows: set FLASK_APP=app.py
flask shell
>>> from app import db
>>> db.create_all()
>>> exit()
```

### 4. Run the server

```bash
flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=5001
Server will be available at http://127.0.0.1:5001
```

## 📊 Database Schema

### Projects
- `id` (Primary Key)
- `slug` (Unique identifier)
- `name` (Project name)
- `codebook` (JSON coding schema)
- `video_count` (Number of videos)
- `created_at` (Timestamp)

### Results
- `id` (Primary Key)
- `project_id` (Foreign Key to Projects)
- `coder_id` (Foreign Key to Coders)
- `video_id` (Video identifier)
- `categories` (Coded categories and tags)
- `notes` (Coder notes)
- `timestamp` (Submission time)
- `status` (submitted/saved/excluded)
- `excluded` (Boolean flag)

### Coders
- `id` (Primary Key)
- `name` (Coder name)
- `project_id` (Foreign Key to Projects)
- `progress_index` (Current video position)

---

## 📋 Notes

- CSV files are uploaded through the frontend and stored in the uploads directory
- Coder progress (progress_index) is tracked per coder and auto-incremented on submission
- All tag/response data is stored in the results table and can be exported per project
- Support for video exclusion with status tracking
- Results can be exported in CSV format with comprehensive metadata
